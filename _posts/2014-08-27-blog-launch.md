*Welcome!* After discovering some interesting technology (more later) to build a website and start
blogging I thought I'd give it a go.

I've been meaning to do some example code and talks about stuff at work so on the back of my enthusiasm
for this new tech it's time to roll the sleeves up and get started.

I'd love to here any thoughts, comments or questions about the stuff I put up here, please just send me a tweet at [twitter.com/spstorey](https://twitter.com/spstorey)

Thanks alot
